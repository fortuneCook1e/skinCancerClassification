# ü©∫ Skin Cancer Diagnosis System using Deep Learning

A **computer-aided diagnosis system** built with deep learning to distinguish between benign and malignant skin cancer cells. This project employs a two-stage approach, leveraging **U-Net** for image segmentation and **InceptionV3** for classification, further enhanced with an attention module for improved accuracy and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Two-Stage Diagnosis Pipeline**:
  - **Stage 1**: Image segmentation using **U-Net** to isolate regions of interest (ROIs).
  - **Stage 2**: Classification using **InceptionV3** to identify benign or malignant cancer cells.

- **Attention Mechanism**:
  - Integrated an attention module to enhance the model‚Äôs focus on critical areas, improving overall performance.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Built a web application using **Flask** for easy interaction and visualization of results.

- **Preprocessing**:
  - Utilized **OpenCV** for image preprocessing, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
